# 🧸✨ White Invisibility Cloak

### 🪄 **Wait… did I just build an invisibility cloak with JavaScript?**

Yeah. I did.

---

## 🤔 **What is this?**

This is a **real-time invisibility cloak** for anything white you show to your webcam.  
Think Harry Potter – except instead of a $500 invisibility cloak, you just need:

✅ A white cloth  
✅ Your webcam  
✅ My brain (coded for you, you’re welcome)

---

## 🛠️ **How does it work?**

In short: **computer vision magic**.

In long:

1. **Captures the background** (3 seconds, hide your beautiful face first)
2. Streams your webcam feed in real-time
3. Converts every pixel from **RGB to HSV** (because HSV is how humans think about color)
4. Checks for high brightness + low saturation (that’s “white” for the uninitiated)
5. Makes those pixels **transparent** so the background shows instead

💡 **Same concept used in:**
- Snapchat AR filters  
- Green screens  
- That expensive adaptive camouflage DARPA’s been cooking up

## 🚀 **Try it live**

Don’t blame me if your dog disappears forever.

---

## ⚙️ **How to run it locally**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/white-invisibility-cloak.git
cd white-invisibility-cloak
# Just open index.html in your browser
```

✅ Works best on Chrome (because life isn’t fair).

---

## 🧠 **Why did I build this?**

Because I wanted to:

- Understand **real-time video processing**  
- Master **Canvas API pixel manipulation**  
- Flex on my friends by becoming **JavaScript Potter**

---

## 😎 **Cool flexes in this code**

✅ Uses **navigator.mediaDevices** like a pro  
✅ Converts RGB to HSV like it’s child’s play  
✅ Uses **requestAnimationFrame** for smooth performance  
✅ Actually works

## 🏆 **Challenge for you**

Think you’re creative?

🎬 Make the **coolest video** using this cloak. Quote me with **#ReabotVr** and show everyone why you’re him/her/them too and tag me  Reabot6 on everywhere, or just clone fork this and do something better if you can that is..
